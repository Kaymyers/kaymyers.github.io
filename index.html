  <h3><strong>About Myself and My Future Career Goals</strong></h3>
  <p>Hello! My name is Kaylyn Myers and I want to become a therapist. Next year I will graduate with a bachelors in Psychology, and continue to grad school to recieve a masters in counseling.</p>      
  <p>Psychology to me is a way in which we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us. Having deep understanding of our minds can make us healthier, happier, and more successful.</p>
